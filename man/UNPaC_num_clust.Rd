(default=TRUE)}

\item{var_selection}{should dimension be reduced using feature filtering procedure? See description below. (default=FALSE)}

\item{p.adjust}{p-value adjustment method for additional feature filtering. See \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}}

}
\value{
The function returns a list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item{\code{BestK}}: {A matrix with 1 row and 4 columns named: "Max_CI","Max_CI_wi_1SE","Max_scaled_CI" and "Max_logWCSS_wi_1SE".
These correspond to the number of clusters, K, chosen by four different rules. "Max_CI choses K to maximize the difference in CI's between the true data and the
reference data. "Max_CI_wi_1SE" uses the "1-SE" criterion as in Tibshirani et al (2001), except for the CI.
"Max_scaled_CI" chooses K to maximize the difference in CIs from the observed and reference data scaled by the standard error of the reference data CIs.
"Max_logWCSS_wi_1SE" uses the Gap statistic and the "1-SE" criterion (Tibshirani et al, 2001) for choosing K.}
\item{\code{full_process}}: {A matrix containing the number of clusters, K, evaluated, the CI from the data, the average CI from the null
distribution, the difference between the data CI and average null CI, the standard error for the difference in CIs, the log of the within cluster dispersion from the data,
the average log of within cluster dispersion from the null data, The difference in within cluster dispersion (the Gap statistic), and the standard error for the Gap statistic.}
\item{\code{selected_features}}: {A vector of integers indicating the features retained by the feature filtering process.}}

\description{
UNPaC for estimating the number of clusters Compares the cluster index (CI) from the original data to that
produced by clustering a simulated ortho-unimodal reference distribution generated using a Gaussian copula.
The CI is defined to be the sum of the within-cluster sum of squares about the cluster means divided by the total sum of squares.
The number of clusters is chosen to maximize the difference between the data cluster index and the
reference cluster indices, but additional rules are also implemented (See below).  This method is described in Helgeson, Vock, and Bair (2021).
}
\details{
There are three options for the covariance matrix used in generating the Gaussian
copula: sample covariance estimation, \code{cov="est"}, which should be used if n>p; the graphical lasso,
\code{cov="glasso"}, which should be used if n<p; and  k-banded covariance, \code{cov="banded"}, which can be used if n<p and it can be assumed that
features farther away in the ordering have weaker covariance. The graphical lasso is implemented using the \code{\link[huge]{huge}} function.
When \code{cov="banded"} is selected the k-banded covariance Cholesky factor of Rothman, Levina, and Zhu (2010) is used to estimate the covariance matrix.
Cross-validation is used for selecting the banding parameter. See documentation in \code{\link[PDSCE]{band.chol.cv}}.

In high dimensional (n<p) settings a dimension reduction step can be implemented which selects features
based on an F-test for difference in means across clusters. Features having a p-value less than a threshold
\code{gamma} are retained. For additional feature filtering a p-value adjustment procedure (such as p.adjust="fdr")
can be used. If no features are retained the resulting p-value for the cluster significance test is given as 1.
